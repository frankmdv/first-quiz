# Introduction

Security is a fundamental principle and element in technology and systems in general.
to guarantee that all information and processes managed within a company are maintained
insurance. For this example, the OWASP Top 10 will be used to illustrate how they should be identified.
and reduce the most likely and obvious security risks.

# Security Audit

To begin, a security audit must be planned and carried out for the entire technological infrastructure.
that is managed in the company. This will allow you to identify each of the tasks that must be performed, analyze
each of the components involved in the defined tasks and identify the possible vulnerabilities that
they can or are presenting themselves.

## OWASP 10

### Loss of access control

The company offers a mobile application and a web interface for customers to interact with it. 
Company employees also have access to the application and database.

An attacker could exploit a security vulnerability to gain access to the application or database. 
This could allow you to access sensitive information such as customer passwords, addresses, and phone numbers.

To mitigate this risk, the company should implement the following measures:

- Implement an identity and access management (IAM) solution to manage access to resources and data.
- Apply role-based access controls to restrict data access to authorized users.
- Encrypt all sensitive information, both at rest and in transit.

### Cryptographic failures:

The company stores sensitive information in the database, such as passwords and credit card information.

An attacker could exploit a security vulnerability to decrypt sensitive information. 
This could allow you to access information in an unauthorized manner.

To mitigate this risk, the company should implement the following measures:

- Use secure encryption algorithms.
- Keep confidential information encrypted at all times.
- Update encryption periodically to avoid known vulnerabilities.

### Injection:

Users can enter data into the application through the web interface and mobile application.

An attacker could exploit an injection vulnerability to inject malicious code into the application. 
This could allow you to take control of the application or access sensitive information.

To mitigate this risk, the company should implement the following measures:

Validate all user input data before processing.
Use input filters to protect against injection attacks.
Use character escape techniques to protect against injection attacks.

### Unsafe design:

The company should ensure that the application is designed with security in mind. This includes the use of 
secure design principles, such as separation of duties and limitation of privileges.

The company should also ensure that the application is well documented to help developers identify 
and fix security issues.

### Incorrect security settings:

The company must ensure that the application is configured correctly. This includes installing 
the latest security updates and configuring the app with recommended security settings.

### Vulnerable and obsolete components:

The company must ensure that the application components are updated to the latest version. 
Outdated components may contain known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.

The company must also perform security testing of application components to detect vulnerabilities.

### Identification and authentication failures:

The company must ensure that users are properly authenticated before they can access the application. 
This includes using secure authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication.

### Software and data integrity failures:

The company must ensure that the application software is well tested for bugs and vulnerabilities. 
You should also ensure that data is stored securely to prevent corruption or unauthorized access.
